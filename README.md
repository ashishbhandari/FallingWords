FALLING WORDS

Idea

The task is to write a small language game. The player will see a word in language „one“ on the screen. While this word is displayed, a word in language „two“ will fall down on the screen. The player will have to choose if the falling word is the correct translation or a wrong translation. The player needs to answer, before the word reaches the bottom of the screen. Include a counter that gives the player feedback.


Third party libraries:

All third parties library licenses are mentioned in licenses.html file inside assets directory of a project.


Assumptions:

Major focus on to keep things simple and working, so no effort on UI.

Application not to be designed for tablets, but still it should work up to 7 inches screen sizes.

As of now application supports only portrait mode.
